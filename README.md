# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe game made fully by myself!

Discord tag: minivik

IMPORTANT:
Windows detects the .exe file as suspicious. You have to click on "more info" and then "run anyways".
I'm working in a solution for this problem, but I do not have it already, sorry for the inconvenience.

I'm currently at first year of game develop university. I actually liked a lot the programming lessons and I write code while I'm bored.

I developed this tiny Tic Tac Toe game (or "TaTeTÃ­" in Argentinian spanish). It's really simple and the code is made with the most basic structures.

This is nothing more than a practice of C# and different structures I learned.

Hope you like it. Every tip or comment will be very apreciated <3
